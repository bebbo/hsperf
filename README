== VERSION ==

2016-01-04: V2
* added ".min 0" to each counter to avoid spikes

2016-01-04: V1

== USAGE ==

1. unzip the archive content to /opt/hsperf
2. adjust the folders, graphs and properties in the file plugins/hsperf
3. copy the files from plugin-conf.d and plugins to the corresponding folders
   in /etc/munin
4. restart munin-node (systemctl restart munin-node)

== WHAT THIS PLUGIN DOES ==

This plugin reads the hsperfdata files of the specified folders: (/tmp/hsperfdata_username/)
If there are more instances per user then the process id will appear in the graph legend.
Nicest results are achieved if every jvm instance is run with an unqiue user,
because there is no changing process id.

== HINTS ==

To get a list of all available properties, run the script
  /opt/hsperf/plugins/hsperf --showprops
and it will display all available properties.
